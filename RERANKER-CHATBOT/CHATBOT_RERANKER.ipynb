With these steps, India is poised to become a 5 trillion dollar economy,\" it had said.The BJP will also push for the passage of the contentious triple talaq bill and citizenship (amendment) bill, which were blocked by the opposition in Parliament.Modi on Thursday led BJP towards a super-sized victory for a second term in office, as his message of nationalism, security, Hindu pride and a New India was wholeheartedly embraced by voters across large swathes of the country.Such was the sweep of its victory that the BJP bagged near 50 per cent and even much more in many states, including Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.It has also put up its best ever show in states like West Bengal and Odisha.It, however, failed to make much impression in southern states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, two states where it failed to open account.', 'url': 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/bjp-likely-to-push-its-political-agenda-with-renewed-vigour/articleshow/69468893.cms'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None),\n",

But the way these governments functioned, a large part of population remained deprived of development.\\n\\n\"These people had a feeling that independence brought no benefit for them,\" he said, without taking the name of the Congress party.\\n\\nHe then highlighted the achievements of the BJP-led government at the Centre.\\n\\n\"After assuming office (in May 2014), the first task Modiji took up was to uplift 50 crore people. In these four years, he brought 30 crore citizens in the formal economy by opening their bank accounts. More than 4.5 crore women were given LPG connections, while 7.5 crore toilets were built during that period,\" Shah said.\\n\\nContinuing his attack on the Congress, the BJP chief said though many people sacrificed their lives during the freedom struggle, attempts were made to give credit for Independence to one party or a particular family.\\n\\n\"The party which came to power immediately after Independence has abolished internal democracy in the party. It has become family-centric. A party which has failed to preserve its own internal democratic structure can never preserve the country\\'s democracy,\" Shah said.\\n\\n\"If we want to preserve democracy in our country, we must establish internal democracy in politics. Since that did not happen in the past, our country could not achieve desired results post-independence,\" the BJP chief said.\\n\\nShah said the Indian Space Research Organisation realised its full potential after the Modi government came to power. This was reflected in the ISRO sending a record number of satellites in space in one go in early 2017, he added.\\n\\n\"In the past, the ISRO used to launch one or two or a maximum 13 satellites at one go. But after Modiji came (to power), ISRO launched 104 satellites in one go, leaving the US behind.\\n\\n\"We did that with the same scientists and resources which were there in the past,\" Shah said.\\n\\nReferring to the World Economic Forum meet in Davos earlier this year, he again targeted the Congress, saying previous prime ministers - most of them from the Congress party - were concerned about getting photos clicked with world leaders at the conclave.\\n\\n\"In the past, there existed no chance for Indian PMs to address the forum. But this time, despite the presence of many world leaders, Modiji got the privilege to inaugurate the meet and gave his speech in Hindi,\" he said.\\n\\nCommenting on the surgical strikes across the LoC in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, he said Modi\\'s go-ahead to the armed forces for the 2016 raid put India in the league of nations such as the US and Israel, which are known to avenge the killing of their soldiers.\\n\\nShah urged the youth to join Modi\\'s mission to build a New India by 2022.\\n\\nThe BJP leader said the New India will be a society free of casteism, poverty, community divisions, dynastic political system, corruption and politics of appeasement.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s take a pledge to build a New India as envisaged by Modiji, who is the most charismatic and popular leader in the world. We all are lucky to have him at the helm of affairs in the country,\" Shah said.', 'url': 'https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/politics/shah-tears-into-congress-says-it-cant-preserve-democracy-2711701.html'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=None)]"
